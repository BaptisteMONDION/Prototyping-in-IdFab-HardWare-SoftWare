README - Capacitron Duel: Interactive Reflex and Speed Game

Game Description

Capacitron Duel is a two-player reflex and speed game inspired by classic arcade games. The rules are simple: it’s a head-to-head test of reflexes and precision.

Objective of the Game

Two players compete, each using a sensor. The game continues until one player reaches 9 points, ending the match. Here’s how it works: when the red LED lights up, players must avoid touching their sensor, or they lose a point. After a random delay, the green LEDs light up; the first player to touch their sensor scores a point.

Project Stages

This project uses a prototyping methodology to efficiently design and test the game. Key stages of development include:

Conceptualization and Modeling

Partquest: Electrical schematic modeling for the game.
COMSOL: Simulation of physical forces and analysis of electrodes to optimize performance.
Preliminary Testing: A functional prototype with a single electrode on a board to validate the detection model.
Final Design:
KiCad: PCB design for the final circuit.
Autodesk Inventor: Modeling and preparation of parts for 3D printing.
STM32 CubeIDE: Programming ST boards to manage game functions.
Visual Studio: Organizing and structuring the code for clarity and maintainability.
